# Lottery

This is a pet project for a YEP's lucky drawing event. Feel free forking and adjusting it to your needs.
Since this project is kinda small so I doesn't enforce DRY or clean coding. Please take note of this!

## Instruction Regarding Database

I'm using Supabase as the database here. Please use your own database for this to work!

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
